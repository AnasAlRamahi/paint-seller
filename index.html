        <h3>Interior Paint and Stains</h3>
        <p>To save time when painting inside your home, choose a paint and primer in one to provide better coverage in less time. While choosing a paint color, it’s also important to think about which sheen you prefer. Below are different sheen types and the rooms they’re best suited for:
            
            Flat: Ideal for ceilings and areas where slight imperfections may be visible. Because they’re harder to clean, flat paints are best for low-traffic areas.
            
            Satin, Low-Luster or Eggshell: These finishes offer some sheen and are much easier to clean than flat paints. They’re great for high-traffic areas such as hallways, bathrooms, bedrooms and playrooms.
            
            Semi-Gloss or Gloss: Glossy surfaces are easier to keep clean, making semi-gloss and gloss paint popular for kitchens and bathrooms. Gloss paint is also a great way to bring out architectural details including entry doors and trim. One thing to keep in mind about gloss and semi-gloss paint: It’s easier to see imperfections in glossier finishes.</p>

            <h3>Exterior Paint</h3>
            <p>Whether you need epoxy paint for your garage floor, paint to refresh the exterior of your home or to update your outdoor fencing, we have all types of exterior paint to choose from. There are two main types of exterior paint:
            
            Solvent-Based (Oil or Alkyd): These paints dry to a smooth, hard surface and can withstand the elements. They can take up to 24 hours to dry and work well for applications like exterior doors and metal railings.
            
            Water-Based (Latex): These paints are fast-drying and clean up more easily than oil-based paint. Because latex paint expands in warm temperatures and contracts in cool temperatures, it’s durable under varying weather conditions.</p>
        <p>In addition to all the paint you could need, including specialty options like chalk paint, we also have every tool and accessory for painting projects, from quality brushes, HVLP paint sprayers, drop cloths, painters tape and more.
